Analysis of climate data.

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to gather recorded temperatures on the island of Oahu for the months of June and December in the years 2010-2017. Once the information was gathered, a basic statistical summary was done to compare temperatures in the selected months. (see results). This analysis comes after a broader analysis of weather on the island in order to determine if it is a good location for W. Avy's ice cream and surf shop.
