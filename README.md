Analysis of climate data.

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to gather recorded temperatures on the island of Oahu for the months of June and December in the years 2010-2017. Once the information was gathered, a basic statistical summary was done to compare temperatures in the selected months. (see results). This analysis comes after a broader analysis of weather on the island in order to determine if it is a good location for W. Avy's ice cream and surf shop.

## Results

While weather on the island is fairly consistent throughout the year, there are some notable differences between the months of June and December:
    <br>1. The mean temperature is 3 degrees higher in June.
    <br>2. The minimum temperature in December (56) is much lower than the minimum temperature in June (64).
    <br>3. There are less recorded temperatures available for December.
    
## Summary
The standard deviation in both months is similar, showing that the spread of temperatures is relatively small. This consistent weather suggests that this location would be great for W. Avy's surf and ice cream shop. Of course, temperature is not the only aspectof climate that is important when determining in this is a good location.

Two additional queries that could be run to build a more complete picture would be:
    1. How much precipitation Oahu gets in June and December.
    2. What wind patterns are like in oahu in June and December.
